### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:

**Build Errors:**
- Clean and rebuild project: `Build ‚Üí Clean Project` then `Build ‚Üí Rebuild Project`
- Invalidate caches: `File ‚Üí Invalidate Caches and Restart`
- Sync project with Gradle files: `File ‚Üí Sync Project with Gradle Files`

**Device Not Detected:**
- Enable USB Debugging in Developer Options
- Install proper USB drivers for your device
- Try different USB cables or ports

**Emulator Issues:**
